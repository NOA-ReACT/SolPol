# SolPol Data format

In order to properly read raw SolPol data with the `solpol_data.py`, use the following naming convension:

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class polirisXX
  polirisXX : Index for solpol iris size
  polirisXX: 55 for 5.5mm, 45 for 4.5mm, 7 for 7mm
  class Date
  Date: in DDMMYYYY, e.g. 02092020
  class Time
  Time: Start time in HHMM UTC, e.g. 0721
  class Location
  Location: Instrument location as antik, ath, cyp, mndl
  class Duration
  Duration: Measurement duration e.g. twohour
  polirisXX ..> Date
  Date ..> Time
  Time ..> Location

```

‚ùó In (`test_data/`) there is a two-hour measurement test file as poliris55\_02092020\_0721\_antik\_twohour.txt.


## Header
The raw data `header` is:

SOLAR POLARIMETER

1. `Polarimeter Position [deg]`:
Instrument rotational position at 0 and 45 degrees from reference

2. `Rotator Position [deg]`:
Polarizer position in sets of [0, 40, 130, 220, 310] in degrees

3. `PEM Setting [nm]`:
Photoelastic Modulator Head operating wavelength, default 550nm

4. `Retardation [waves]`:
PEM induced retardation

5. `Wavelength Filter (Wavelength-Bandwidth)`:
Filter wheel filter selection, default 550nm

6. `ND-Filter`:
Neutral density 0.3 filter (pre-defined)

7. `Time (UTC)`:
Measurement starting time in HH:MM:SS (UTC)

8. `Bias Voltage on Diode`
Should be zero if instrument working properly, forward bias

9. `LabJack, mean DC (AIN0)`:
DC output voltage from the DAQ in Volts

10. `LabJack, other`:
State zero if instrument works properly

11. `Lock-in, 1w`:
RMS Voltage output from channel 1 of the Lock-in amplifier, signal phase on resonant frequency (œâ) in degrees

12. `Lock-in, 2w`:
RMS Voltage output from channel 2 of the Lock-in amplifier, signal phase on twice the resonant frequency (2œâ) in degrees

## üî¥IMPORTANTüî¥

‚ùó Data file to be valid needs to contain **5** sets of measurements [1-12 above] for each `Rotator Position [deg]` per `Polarimeter Position [deg]`. <br />


‚ùó Every valid file stops at a `Polarimeter Position [deg]` == 45 degs  & `Rotator Position [deg]` == 310.
