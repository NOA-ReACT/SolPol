~~Instrument manual and data processing algorithm for the NOA/UH - Solar Polarimeter (SolPol)~~

This repository contains everything related to the operation, characterization and data manipulation of the SolPol - Solar polarimeter, as operated by the NOA-ReACT team. The instrument was conferred to the National Observatory of Athens by the University of Hertfordshire in the framework of the D-TECT/ERC project.

**SolPol** is a passive polarimetric ground-based instrument that targets directly the Sun and has measuring capabilities of a few parts per million (ppms) in linear polarization and of the order of $10^{-7}$ in circular polarization. It is based on the existing design of the PlanetPol high sensitivity polarimeter as described in Hough et al., 2006. The instrument's usage in laboratory conditions is described in Martin et al., 2010.

Period of operation: extensive measurements and tests between August 2018 to November 2022.
Operation locations: i. the PANGEA observatory in Antikythera (primarily), ii. the National Observatory of Athens (partially), iii. the Cyprus Institute, Nicosia, Cyprus (during 2019 campaign) and iv. the OSCM Institute, Mindelo, Cabo Verde (during ASKOS 2022 campaign).
